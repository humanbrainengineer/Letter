# Letter

To:
Ian Murdock.

I am Chinese in Canton.
I know you left, I was very sad.

I always think you are so young, in the end what happened.
I think it's not so easy to commit suicide.
Maybe, it's the other reason that causes you to die.
I hope that people in the Debian community, you should help Ian Murdock 's family to deal with the death.

I'm looking forward to Debian 9.0 （Stretch ）.
I hope you are happy.
